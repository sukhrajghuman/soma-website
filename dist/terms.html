              <h3><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>
              <p>This Site is intended solely for Users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older, and any registration by, use of or access to the Site by anyone under 18 is unauthorized, unlicensed and in violation of these Terms of Service. By using the Service or the Site, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older and that you agree to and to abide by all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service.</p>
              <p>The segment of our Service (and certain web pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein are available only to certain eligible, registered and authorized users. Such segments of our Service and the Site may therefore not be available in all jurisdictions or to all Users. Where sample investment opportunities are displayed on public pages for illustrative purposes, only eligible Users will be able to view the full offering details.</p>
              <p>For persons who reside in the United States, only <a href="https://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm">“accredited investors”</a> as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), with a valid user id and password, are authorized to access such services and web pages (such persons being “accredited investors”). Generally, to qualify as an accredited investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. Securities rules and regulations require investors to provide supporting documents to issuers that provide proof that you are an accredited investor. Such authorization may require completion of an accredited investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening. Your failure to provide any information and documentation that is requested to confirm your status as an accredited investor will prevent you from investing in offerings posted on soma.finance and cause SOMADEX to immediately discontinue your use of the service by preventing your access to the website and the service. You agree that in the event any material changes occur after your registration that may affect your status as an accredited investor, you shall immediately notify SOMADEX of such changes in writing.</p>
              <p>Persons who reside outside the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our Services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where SOMADEX or one of its related entities is not authorized to provide such information or services. You agree that it is solely your responsibility to be aware of the applicable laws and regulations of your country of residence. The content provided on this Site does not constitute an offer or solicitation to sell securities referred to on this Site, by anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or distribution would be unlawful or in which the person making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or to anyone to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation.</p>
              <h3><strong>Issuer Information</strong></h3>
              <p>The Site permits Accredited Investors to independently connect with private venture capital funds (“Issuer” or “Fund”), each established for the purpose of investing in a single legal claim or several related or unrelated legal claims. Each Issuer is solely responsible for the material it posts on this Site and, by posting such material, each represents that: (i) it has complied in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations; and (ii) such information will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make such statements not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are made. SOMADEX makes no representations regarding whether any offering materials or content on the Site are complete, truthful and accurate nor is SOMADEX responsible to verify or investigate the completeness, truthfulness and accuracy of such representation or offering materials.</p>
              <p>Federal law requires that Issuers independently verify a User’s status as an Accredited Investor before accepting a subscription, among other requirements. Users agree to cooperate with any requests for additional information or documentation. Each Issuer is responsible for ensuring that its securities offering complies with state and federal law, including without limitation, the use of the Site to offer and sell securities, the determination of whether an investor is an Accredited Investor, and whether any investment complies with the applicable exemption from registering the offering with the SEC. Users of the Site acknowledge that SOMADEX is not liable to and will not verify or investigate the accuracy and completeness of the offering materials and other information posted on the Site. SOMADEX shall have the right but not the obligation to remove, cancel or reject the posting of any securities offerings. Failure to remove, cancel or reject securities offerings suspected of violating the securities laws does not constitute an endorsement or approval of said securities offerings by SOMADEX. The information provided herein shall not be deemed legal advice. You are strongly advised to consult with your own legal counsel.</p>
              <h3><strong>Securities Offerings; No Professional Advice Provided</strong></h3>
              <p>The securities referred to or offered through this Site or this Service have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a) (2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Site or this Service.</p>
              <p>The securities referred to or posted on the Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risks associated with investments in private issuers, including the risk of a complete loss of your investment. Securities sold through private placements are speculative and not publicly traded. Additionally, securities may be subject to restrictions on resale or transfer including holding period requirements. Investing in private placements requires a high risk tolerance, low liquidity need, and long-term commitments. Users must be able to afford to lose their entire investment. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.</p>
              <p>The securities offerings posted on the Site enable you to invest indirectly in legal claims by purchasing securities issued by a single purpose venture capital fund — a separate limited liability company created for the sole purpose of investing in the legal claim (hereinafter the “Fund” or collectively the “Funds”). Our affiliate manages the Funds in accordance with the terms of each Fund’s operating documents. Typically, the investment manager manages, controls, conducts the affairs of the Fund, and exercises any management rights negotiated with the Company. Investors of the Fund do not have the same management rights as the investment manager and may or may not have redemption or withdrawal rights pursuant to the provisions under the Fund’s operating agreement. Investors in the Fund may be charged an administrative fee to cover the actual out-of-pocket costs of the investment fund; the administrative fee is disclosed to the investors at the time of the Fund formation. Investors in a Fund have the benefit of the investment manager’s experience in related transactions. An investment manager may receive a share of any profit (i.e. after you received your principal back) of the Fund for providing management services (“carried interest”), but may not receive any transaction based fees such as commission. Terms may vary so you are required to read all offering materials carefully and consult with your legal, financial and investment counsel. The foregoing description is non-exhaustive and should not be deemed to be legal advice.</p>
              <p>The securities being offered have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance, among other exemptions, on the exemptive provisions of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Issuers represent and warrant that each fund is structured to qualify as an exempt investment company under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), which provides an exemption from registration for a private investment company that (i) has no more than one-hundred (100) beneficial owners; and (ii) does not make or propose to make a public offering of its securities. Users must read each Issuer’s offering memorandum and transaction documents for more information and discuss any questions with each Issuer directly prior to investing. Similar reliance has been placed on apparently available exemptions from securities registration or qualification requirements under applicable state securities laws. No assurance can be given that any offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under one or more of such exemptive provisions due to, among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or a change of any securities law or regulation that has retroactive effect. The exemptions relied upon for such offerings are significantly dependent upon the accuracy of the representations of the Users to be made to the Site and Issuers on the Site in connection with the offering. In the event that any such representations prove to be untrue, the registration exemptions relied upon by an Issuer in selling the securities might not be available and substantial liability to such Issuer would result under applicable securities laws for rescission or damages. These risks are non-exhaustive and are intended to highlight certain risks associate with investing in securities that are not registered with the SEC.

              <h3><strong>Consent to Electronic Transactions and Disclosures</strong></h3>

Your consent will remain in effect for so long as you are a User and, if you are no longer a User, will continue until such a time as all Disclosures relevant to transactions that occurred while you were a User have been made.</p>
              <p>You may not withdraw such consent as long as you have outstanding any investments made through the Site. If you have no outstanding investments made through the site and wish to withdraw consent to doing business electronically, we will terminate your registered user account with us.</p>

              <p>If a security token is deemed to be lost, the following actions will occur:</p>
              <ol role="list">
                <li>The holder must provide the customer service with their name, address and account number along with  the  name and type of securities owned, public key, if known, and the reason for the loss (i.e., lost, stolen, destroyed or never received). The customer service team will then notify the token recovery team within the legal group.</li>
                <li>The token recovery group will instruct the technology support to place a temporary transfer hold on the security tokens in question, including a transfer hold on the blockchain if necessary. The security tokens held by such holder will be restricted for transfer and the restriction cannot be removed until the Formal Documentation (defined below) is submitted by the holder and cleared by the token recovery team.</li>
                <li>Once confirmed with the token recovery team, the member of the customer service team assigned to the issuer for which the issue has arisen, will then forward the following documentation (“Formal Documentation”) to the holder for completion:</li>
              </ol>
              <ol role="list">
                <li>The holder shall prepare the attached Affidavit of Loss and Agreement of Indemnity indicating that the holder lost access to the digital wallet in which its security tokens are held, or that the tokens have been misappropriated, and requests that the Company burn/destroy the digital tokens representing the underlying securities and generate replacement digital tokens to a new digital wallet registered to the holder. The signature of the holder of the Affidavit and Indemnity must be witnessed by a notary public.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, the holder may be asked to apply for a surety bond listing the Company as an obligee.</li>
              </ol>
              <ol role="list">
                <li>Upon receipt of the Formal Documentation:</li>
              </ol>
              <ol role="list">
                <li>The compliance officer, in conjunction with the relevant issuer, will re-run KYC checks on the investor to ensure that they provide the same documentation and are the same person/entity who passed KYC for the original wallet.</li>
                <li>The legal group will investigate and determine the veracity of any claims of theft or misappropriation</li>
              </ol>
              <ol role="list">
                <li>Upon completion, the compliance officer will, with the issuer’s consent, proceed to force transfer the lost token to the new digital wallet associated with the holder or, if necessary, burn/destroy the lost tokens and issue replacement tokens to a new digital wallet associated with the holder.</li>
                <li>In the case of securities held by a deceased individual, the Affidavit of Loss and Agreement of Indemnity should be executed by the personal representative of the estate of the decedent. A certified copy of the certificate of appointment of the personal representative (executor, administrator, etc.) of the Estate of the decedent dated within 60 days of the date the Affidavit of Loss and Agreement of Indemnity is signed, must also be provided.</li>
