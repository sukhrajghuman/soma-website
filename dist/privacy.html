              <p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) answers some questions about your nonpublic personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information we collect in connection with your use of soma.finance, including any related subdomain (the “Site”), the SOMADEX services, applications and software provided through or in connection with the service, including through a mobile device (the “Service”), how the information will be used, what we do with it, how we protect it, and your correction or deletion of that information. As of the date listed above, we have made some changes to this Policy that may affect what information we collect about you from either you or from third parties, and with whom that information may be shared. Specifically, certain information we collect about you from third parties concerning your accredited investor status may be shared with certain other third parties in accordance with this Policy.</p>
              <p>This Policy together with the Terms of Service (the “Terms”) (collectively, the “Agreement”) constitutes a contract between you and SOMADEX and governs your use of the Site and/or the Service and set forth the terms and conditions between you and SOMADEX when you access or use the Site or in connection with the Service, including participation or browsing.

SOMADEX reserves the right to use and control the information collected on the Site. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreement and consent to the practices described in the Agreement.</p>
              <p>In the course of providing products and services, we need to collect and maintain certain nonpublic personally identifiable information about you. We may use this personal information about you to: (a) service and maintain your account, (b) to provide the Service, (c) facilitate communication between you and other users, (d) respond to inquiries from you or your representative, (e) develop, offer, and deliver products and services (f) to serve advertisements on the Site, (g) to enable our vendors and contractors to provide and assist us in the marketing, operation, troubleshooting and analysis of the Site and other services, (h) to analyze data to send more targeted messages to you or other users of our Site, (i) to conduct research and analyze data to improve our products, services, and the Site, (j) to deliver email messages like special offers, updates, newsletters, customer service, and service announcements, (k) to comply with and meet any regulatory requirements for the offer or sale of securities required by law, rules or regulations to our affiliates or members, (l) to protect the Site or its users, (m) to engage in any other lawful activities we believe are consistent with the foregoing; and (n) when required by law or to protect against legal liability. This personal information may include your name, email address, home address and phone number, date of birth, social security number and/or tax identification number, employer, and job title. When you subscribe to make an investment in one of the opportunities listed on the Site, you will again be asked for some of the same personal data as well as some additional data, such as your bank routing number and bank account number. This data is needed in order to enable ourselves or our broker-dealer partners to utilize your bank account to originate funds transfers and later to make investment disbursements to you.</p>
              <p>We use reasonable efforts to secure access to personally identifiable information in our possession, but will not be liable for any failure to safeguard such information, whether inadvertent or otherwise.</p>
              <p>Tritaurian Capital, Incorporated (“TTC”), a securities broker/dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., is a provider of execution and other services related to the equity securities transaction aspects of our business.</p>

              <p>Since we do not have direct control over the policies and practices of TTC, or any third-party vendor or partner, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of their sites. In addition to notifying TTC, we will also notify the party or parties offering (or issuing) the investment of your interest, and may notify other users in the event that you have chosen to share such information.</p>
              <p>We may make your information, including non-personally identifiable information or personally identifiable information, available on the Site and visible to other users of or visitors to the Site. For instance, subject to certain preferences and permissions as to visibility you will be allowed to make, information you provide about yourself in response to questionnaires on the Site may be made available to others such as information concerning your status as an accredited investor. As such, other users of the Site may be able to personally identify you based on your information made available on the Site. As a further example, if you utilize third-party services to log into the Site, other users to whom you may be connected to through such third-party service may be able to view or follow information about you, including non-personally identifiable information or personally identifiable information, on the Site.</p>
              <p>When you register as a user on the Service, you will receive emails that confirm specific actions you requested, including emails to which you must respond to complete your registration, and notifications confirming your registration. Thereafter, you may receive emails when a new investment opportunity is offered, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such opportunity or offering other relevant information. If you make an investment through the Site, we or TTC will also send you non-brokerage confirmations of the investment and occasional updates as to the status of that investment and the timing of distributions relating to that investment. We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to time, we will also send user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site operations or marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our marketing partners. The completion of these surveys or requests for feedback or acceptance of any offer is strictly voluntary. If you do not wish to receive these offers, surveys or user feedback emails, please opt out in any offer email you receive from us.</p>
              <p>When you access the Service, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address (“IP address”), pages visited, general statistical and tracking information, your computer operating system and browser information, and average time spent on our Sites. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our Web design and functionality. We train our employees about privacy and limit access to this information. To maintain security of your online session and prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account we use firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures.</p>
              <p>We will not sell, rent, license, or disclose any of your nonpublic personally identifiable information to any nonaffiliated third parties, except as described below. If you decide to close your account, SOMADEX will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described in this notice.</p>
              <p>We collect information about our users in four ways: (a) directly from the user, (b) from our web server logs, (c) through cookies, web-beacons, and server logs, and (d) from third parties with whom we may have agreements to perform certain functions or services on our behalf.</p>
              <h3><strong>Information Collected Through Users</strong></h3>
              <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting on the Site (“User Content”) becomes available to the public. You can view and modify this information within the self-maintenance area of the Site. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the site. We have the right to remove any information or material posted on the Site for any reason or no reason, including without limitation, if in our sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law, the Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. We also reserve the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>
              <p>The following information may be collected in connection with your use of the Site and Services:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Information you provide online and on applications or other forms, or through discussions we have with you or your representatives, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, Social Security number, date of birth, income, employment information, investment experience, and any information about your personal goals or objectives;</li>

              </ul>
              <h3><strong>E-mail</strong></h3>
              <p>If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses in our email records. We will retain emails that are sent from SOMADEX to you. Emails are subject to archival, monitoring or review by and/or disclosure to, someone other than the recipient. We retain email correspondence to build records of our relationship and to measure and improve our service. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.</p>
              <p>You may receive periodic updates emails from SOMADEX. You may opt-out of the emails at any time. Instructions for unsubscribing are included in each email.</p>
              <h3><strong>Cookies, Web-Beacons &amp; Server Logs</strong></h3>
              <p>Cookies are small text files, which often include a unique but anonymous code, sent by a Site server to your Web browser and stored on your computer. They recognize you as a repeat visitor, allowing you to log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site and the general user experience. Cookies do not identify you by name as an individual or by account number. Cookies also track traffic patterns on our Site, helping us understand how you are using our Site. This information allows us to improve the security, content, navigation and functionality of our Site. Cookies note that your browser was used to visit certain sites, pages, or advertisements on a certain date, but are not used to collect or disseminate any personal information.</p>
              <p>Additionally, we use cookies on our Sites and the sites on which we advertise to track advertising performance and to collect aggregate data on Web page viewing. We may contract with third-party service providers (e.g. Google Analytics) to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
              <p>You can manually disable cookies. You should review the online documentation of your browser or consult with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies. However, disabling cookies may cause some parts of the Site to not function properly.</p>
              <p>A “web beacon” is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email which allows the website to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon. “Server logs” can be either a single log file or several log files automatically created and maintained by a server of activity performed by the server, which can include information about any transaction you conduct with the server.</p>
              <h3><strong>Internet Protocol (IP) Address</strong></h3>
              <p>As you enter our Site, we capture and retain the IP address of the device you are using, such as a personal computer or a handheld device. The IP address does not identify you or your personal information and is used for security purposes only. We may use this information to monitor and prevent fraud, diagnose problems, and (anonymously) estimate demographic information.</p>
              <h3><strong>Nonpublic Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h3>
              <p>In the event that you request access to the confidential investment details and business details of an offering on the Site or the Service, the email address linked to your SOMADEX user account may be furnished to the issuer to facilitate communication between you.</p>
              <p>SOMADEX does not sell, rent, or license, or otherwise disclose nonpublic personally identifiable information about current or former clients to anyone, except in cooperation with the government and regulatory agencies with a lawful summons, court order, subpoena, fraud investigation, audit or regulatory examination, investigations of a violation of legal rights of SOMADEX or any other person, or as permitted or required by law, to non-affiliated third parties that help us provide services to you. For example, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires that we verify your accredited investor status before you may invest in any offerings made available through our Site. Toward that end, SOMADEX employs or contracts with other third parties, companies or individuals, including TTC, to perform certain functions or services on its behalf. Examples of these services from such third parties, companies, or individuals, may include:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>ID verification;</li>
                <li>Accreditation/financial/credit verification;</li>
                <li>Electronic document signing;</li>
                <li>Payment storing and processing;</li>
                <li>Sending postal mail and email;</li>
                <li>Escrow services;</li>
                <li>Disbursement of funds;</li>
                <li>Analyzing data;</li>
                <li>Providing marketing assistance; and</li>
                <li>Providing customer service.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As such, these third parties, companies, or individuals may have access to nonpublic personally identifiable information concerning you that they provide to us. In turn, in order to comply with SEC requirements, we may have to share such information with issuers of securities or other offerings made available on our Site, with broker dealers, or with  TTC, depending on the types of investments you will be making through the Site.</p>
              <p>All non-affiliated third parties that accept or receive this information from us are obligated contractually or by law or regulation to keep this information confidential and to use the information only to provide the services we ask them to perform. These non-affiliated third parties will be provided with only that information necessary to perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. SOMADEX shall be entitled to transfer to a third-party information it maintains, including any personally identifiable information, in connection with a transaction or proceeding involving a transfer of some or all of the assets relating to the Site or a business in connection with which such information is maintained.</p>
              <p>We may store nonpublic personally identifiable information in locations outside of our direct control such as on servers, or databases maintained by hosting providers. You may decline to submit nonpublic personally identifiable information through SOMADEX, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time in your online profile.</p>
              <p>SOMADEX may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the Agreement.</p>
              <p>If you use our blog on the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this forum, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.</p>
              <h3><strong>Protecting Your Information</strong></h3>
              <p>SOMADEX uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We employ a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools.
